    description: `I developed a web application using Oracle, PL/SQL, .NET (4.0), JavaScript, jQuery, and Bootstrap, where people can subscribe by entering their email, which is then validated and confirmed. The panel is divided between notices and notifications. Whenever a message is sent, an email alert is sent to the subscriber, prompting them to access the panel to view the notice or notification.
    The application is designed to provide an efficient and user-friendly experience for subscribers, ensuring that they are always up-to-date with the latest information. The use of Oracle and PL/SQL ensures that the application is robust and reliable, while .NET and JavaScript provide a flexible and dynamic front-end. The use of Bootstrap and jQuery further enhances the user experience by providing responsive design and intuitive functionality.
    Overall, my experience in developing this application has been both challenging and rewarding, as I have been able to utilize my skills in various technologies and programming languages to create a comprehensive and efficient web application`,

    description: `I developed a web application using Oracle, PL/SQL, .NET (4.0), JavaScript, Vue.js 2 (CDN), and Bootstrap, which allows users to file claims by submitting PDF documentation and additional information. The application validates the submitted data in real-time and rejects the claim if there is any inconsistency between what the user declares and what the client has on record.

    The use of Oracle and PL/SQL ensures that the application is robust and reliable, while .NET provides a flexible and dynamic front-end. The use of Vue.js and Bootstrap further enhances the user experience by providing responsive design and intuitive functionality.
    
    One of the key features of this application is its real-time data validation, which ensures that users cannot submit incomplete or inaccurate information. The application also provides users with the ability to submit PDF documentation, which simplifies the claims process and reduces the need for physical documents.`,

    title: "Backend Developer",
    description: `As a developer, I have experience in integrating a payment gateway using web technologies such as Oracle, PL/SQL, and .NET 4.0. With this integration, users can input their information, allowing me to retrieve the debt amount and product description. Through the use of a token and encrypted information, I redirect the user to the payment platform, which takes care of the payment collection process.

    The payment gateway integration I developed is a seamless and secure solution that ensures a smooth transaction process for users. By using Oracle and PL/SQL, I was able to retrieve the necessary information and ensure its security through encryption. Additionally, by using .NET 4.0, I was able to create a user-friendly interface that simplifies the payment process.
    
    Overall, the integration of the payment gateway using web technologies was a successful project that showcased my expertise in software development.`,

    description: `As a developer, I created a web service architecture that involved developing and interconnecting a microservices ecosystem using HTTPS queries. To ensure secure server-to-server communication, I generated certificates and implemented an API gateway that validated tokens issued by the certificate authority responsible for authenticating users through certificate issuance and validation.

    Behind the API gateway, an application for data processing exposed APIs with resources that were routed through the gateway for end-users. I also developed a role-based API that stored user data, created or deleted roles, and granted or revoked roles for users. Active Directory was used to authenticate the personnel responsible for administering roles, while an internal web app developed with React.js allowed them to perform assigned tasks.
    
    To accomplish this, I utilized a variety of technologies, including Node.js, OpenSSL, Docker, React.js, MongoDB, and GitLab. Currently, we are migrating to Nest.js and Next.js to improve integration and group development. All APIs and web apps are dockerized in Ubuntu server for ease of deployment and maintenance.
    
    Overall, the implementation of the web service architecture using Node.js, MongoDB, and other technologies was a successful project that showcased my expertise in developing and deploying secure and scalable systems.`,
