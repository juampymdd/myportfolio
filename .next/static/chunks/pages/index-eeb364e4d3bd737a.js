I also developed a role-based API that stored user data, created or deleted roles, and granted or revoked roles for users. Active Directory was used to authenticate the personnel responsible for administering roles, while an internal web app developed with React.js allowed them to perform assigned tasks.\n    \n    To accomplish this, I utilized a variety of technologies, including Node.js, OpenSSL, Docker, React.js, MongoDB, and GitLab. Currently, we are migrating to Nest.js and Next.js to improve integration and group development. All APIs and web apps are dockerized in Ubuntu server for ease of deployment and maintenance.\n    \n    Overall, the implementation of the web service architecture using Node.js, MongoDB, and other technologies was a successful project that showcased my expertise in developing and deploying secure and scalable systems.",from:2021,to:null}],o=[{name:"Product showcase page",description:"This page is designed to showcase our product, featuring images and information about the different models available.
